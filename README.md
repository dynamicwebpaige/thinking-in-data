# üìä Thinking in Data

_Thinking in Data_ is a curated set of VS Code extensions for data analysis, visualization, and collaboration, inspired by the brilliant [_Thinking in Code_](https://github.com/lostintangent/thinking-in-code) extension pack. If you are a data scientist or machine learning engineer who is familiar with RStudio, MATLAB, Spyder, JupyterLab, or other scientific IDEs, but have felt overwhelmed by the Visual Studio extension marketplace: this is a great place to start.
