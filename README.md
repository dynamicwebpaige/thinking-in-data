# üìä Thinking in Data

> **_NOTE:_**  It is **strongly recommended** that you use the [Insiders Edition of Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/), which is updated daily, and includes the latest and most up-to-date features for the Python extension, Live Share, Codespaces, native notebooks, and more.

[![You are urged to use caution when inflating your metrics, dear reader.](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/box_plot.png)](https://xkcd.com/1798)

_Thinking in Data_ is a curated set of VS Code extensions for **data analysis, visualization, and collaboration**, inspired by and including the brilliant [_Thinking in Code_](https://github.com/lostintangent/thinking-in-code) extension pack. If you are a data scientist or machine learning engineer who is familiar with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/), [JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.io/), or other scientific IDEs, but have felt overwhelmed by the [Visual Studio Code extension marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode): this is a great place to start.

üññ **Contributions are welcome:** if you come across an extension that enhances your understanding or accelerates your analysis, please feel free to submit a pull request to add it!
